As you may have noticed, BDCC is a prison facility, housing thousands of the most dangerous criminals from all corners of our galaxy. Have no worry because you will be protected from any dangers by our huge team of professional guards. The location of this prison is classified so you will have to be relocated for semi-permanent living but AlphaCorp will provide everything necessary, including your transit. In exchange, you will be paid at least a minimal salary, enough to cover your living needs and much more. As an engineer, you will be responsible for the smooth operation and maintenance of all systems on board, including advanced resource excavation systems, life support, and security measures.")

		sayn("- Maintain and repair the exterior of the station to withstand the constant exposure to solar radiation and extreme temperatures.")

		sayn("- Oversee the resource excavation systems, which are crucial for maintaining the asteroid's orbit and for power generation.")

		sayn("- Monitor and troubleshoot the security systems to prevent any attempts at escape or sabotage.")

		sayn("- Coordinate with the prison staff and oversee the daily operations of the prison.")

		saynn("- Monitor the prisoners and ensure their basic needs are met.")

		sayn("Qualifications:")

		sayn("- Bachelor's degree in engineering or related field (Would be a great plus)")

		sayn("- At least 5 years of experience in a similar role (Not strictly required)")

		sayn("- Strong knowledge of propulsion systems, life support systems, and security systems (We will teach you everything, just apply!)")

		sayn("- Experience working in a remote or isolated environment (It’s not that bad, really)")

		sayn("- Strong problem-solving and analytical skills (Being strong would help you a lot, yes)")

		sayn("- Excellent communication and interpersonal skills (If you can talk, we can talk)")

		saynn("- This is an excellent opportunity to work in a challenging and unique environment, where you will be responsible for ensuring the safety and security of one of the galaxy's most high-security prisons. If you have a passion for engineering and are up for the challenge, we encourage you to apply. (PLEASE)")

		saynn("Standing behind the window and talking, there are 2 humans that are staring at you and your sterile cell made mostly out of glass. Person on the left wears a guard uniform and has a pulse rifle on him. He holds a tablet with some notes. The guy on the right wears official clothes and seems quite old. They talk while you rest on your personal bed and read some documentation on your datapad.")

		saynn("You try not to stare at them. But it feels like they scan every inch of your body.")

		saynn("[say=directortau]A hacker. Could be a useful skill out there. But. Too situational. Why does she look like that?[/say]")

		saynn("[say=jaxontau]DNA experiments, Sir. She is the result of us trying to find genes that would provide an advantage to someone during a battle. Any weirdness in her looks are the side effects.[/say]")

		saynn("[say=directortau]So, what's the end result? How strong is she? High endurance?[/say]")

		saynn("[say=jaxontau]Average on pretty much every front, sadly. Endurance is on the weaker side I would say. She is tall though. She is one of the first prototypes, used for gene space exploration and splicing.[/say]")

		saynn("The guy on the right frowns and turns to the other one. You begin to feel uncomfortable, scrolling through articles faster on your datapad. But you're still just lying on your bed, not moving too much.")

		saynn("[say=directortau]We need soldiers. Soldiers and spies. That's what the corporation desperately needs right now. And she doesn't fit either category.[/say]")

		saynn("[say=jaxontau]What do you mean, Sir? She knows some fighting techniques already. And she is pretty smart. I think she would make for a great soldier for AlphaCorp.[/say]")

		saynn("[say=directortau]She is too weak to be a soldier. And too.. visible.. to be a spy. Was there at least something useful?[/say]")

		saynn("[say=jaxontau]Yeah, we found genes that control some of her feelings. She.. let me see. Her love, empathy and compassion are mostly blocked. These feelings won't cause dopamine secretion in her brain. We're giving her a special drug that amplifies these effects, that's Quinn's research.[/say]")

		saynn("The main guy holds his chin.")

		saynn("[say=directortau]Well, you should have. Weakest link of any system is people, not machines. If she wants to be useful, she needs to learn how to satisfy anyone with her holes, including the enemy. I will ask again, is she fertile?[/say]")

		saynn("[say=jaxontau]Chances of successful impregnation are pretty much zero, the reproductive cells suffered too much dna-related damage.[/say]")

It's called Bluespace, a separate dimension that will allow us to transmit data across the whole galaxy in an instant.

Apparently the prototype transmitters are already being installed on some of the ships and space stations.")

Okay, have you seen a flashback in a text-based porn game before? x3 You probably didn't! So I hope people are surprised a little to see that they suddenly play as someone else. It really gives a lot of freedom about how your character talks and reacts. Usually I have to write it very generic-ly because the player could be a mean-ass dom or a subby sub, I don't know..\n\nAnything interesting about it? I dunno.. I tried to foreshadow literally everything. Sometimes very obviously, sometimes extremely subtly. I just hope you enjoyed reading that. It's like a little movie script, with explosions, betrayals, villains, heroes, unbelievable escapes.\n\nThe latex thingie idea? I wanted to do that for a long time x3"
